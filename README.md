# NYC Energy Demand Forecast ML Pipeline - Airflow (Kubernetes, AKS, AZCR, Docker) - ML & API (Databricks, MLFlow, AKS) - Infastructure As Code (Terraform)

# Architecture 
# End-to-End ML Pipeline Architecture

This project implements a full **MLOps pipeline** on Azure, connecting **data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, CI/CD, and API deployment** into a reproducible workflow.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Orchestration (Airflow on AKS)
- **Airflow** runs inside **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.  
- Airflow image is built locally and pushed to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.  
- Airflow DAG tasks:
  1. **Ingest**: Pulls raw energy demand data from the **EIA API**.  
  2. **Bronze layer (ADLS Gen2)**: Stores raw ingested data.  
  3. **Silver layer (ADLS Gen2)**: Pre-processed & cleaned data.  
  4. **Gold layer (ADLS Gen2)**: Aggregated + feature-engineered dataset ready for modeling.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Model Training & Registry (Databricks + MLflow)
- **Databricks** reads the **Gold layer** data from ADLS.  
- **MLflow** used for:
  - Training **multiple candidate models** (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM).  
  - Logging metrics, artifacts, and parameters.  
  - Comparing model performance and selecting the **best model**.  
- The **best model.pkl** is exported and versioned locally.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. CI/CD Deployment (GitHub Actions â†’ ACR â†’ AKS)
- When the `model.pkl` file is **committed to `main` branch**, it triggers the **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline**:
  1. **Build Docker image** (FastAPI + Dash app serving the model).  
  2. **Push image to ACR**.  
  3. **Deploy to AKS** via `kubectl set image` update.  
  4. **Dashboard service** is refreshed with the new model image.  

- The **Dash Web App**:
  - Calls the trained model via API.  
  - Provides **interactive forecasts** for future energy demand dates.

# CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions â†’ Azure)

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process.

## Workflow Overview
- **Trigger**: On every push to the `main` branch
- **Steps**:
  1. **Build Docker image** using project `Dockerfile`
  2. **Push image** to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
  3. **Deploy to AKS** by updating Kubernetes deployment with the new image
  4. **Rollout verification** ensures pods are healthy

## Key Components
- **GitHub Actions** workflow defined in [`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml)  
- **Helper scripts**:
  - `scripts/build_docker.sh` â†’ Builds the Docker image
  - `scripts/push_azcr.sh` â†’ Tags & pushes image to ACR
  - `scripts/deploy_aks.sh` â†’ Updates AKS deployment and waits for rollout
